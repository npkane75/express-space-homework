// DEPENDENCIES
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// run `npm install` to install dependencies in package.json

// * Your mission is to complete the app
// * The app will need routes for index and show
// * The app will need views for index and show

// INDEX Route
// send data to 'missions/index.ejs' view
// the view should display just the names of each mission
// display the mission names as <li> in a <ul> with the class name "missions"

// SHOW Route
// send data to 'missions/show.ejs' view
// the view should display all the data for a single mission

// * Bonus/Hungry for More: User should be able to click on a mission’s name on the index page, and be taken to that mission’s show page to view the data
// * Bonus/Hungry for More: add images to the data and have them display (google how)
// * Bonus/Hungry for More: add static css to style the pages (google how)
